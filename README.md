# deloop

Short for loop-de-loop.

Homemade DAW in disguise as a live-performance looper.

Still in heavily development. Check back in a few months when I make time to push local hacking.

## Usage

If a JACK server is already running:
```
cargo run
```

If on a Linux system using pipewire:
```
pw-jack cargo run
```
